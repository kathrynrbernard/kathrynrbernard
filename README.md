### Hi there 👋

*Pronouns (she/her/hers)*

🐦 I am a GIS Specialist in Conservation Science with the National Audubon Society - I make maps, interactive web experiences, and models to inform and prioritize bird conservation across the Great Lakes and Upper Mississippi River regions.

🎓 I recently completed a master's degree in in environmental conservation, GIS, and remote sensing at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://nelson.wisc.edu/graduate/professional-programs/environmental-observation-and-informatics/). 
📊 I'm interested in data visualization and web mapping as tools to communicate environmental issues.

🌲 I love spending time outside however I can - my favorite hobbies are rock climbing, running, backpacking, and gardening.

📕 I also love reading, cooking, baking, and listening to music in my free time.
